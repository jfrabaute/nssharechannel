===========

* IMPORTANT NOTE :
     
     This problem has been in TCL version 8.4 and more.
     If you are using AS4.0 or AS3.x with TCL 8.4 forget this WARNING
     
     WARNING TCL < 8.4 :
     Due to a bug I cannot solve, the shared channel will be opened forever.
     So do not forget to flush the channel !! That's really important.
     The problem is that calling Tcl_UnregisterChannel with "interp" parameter
     as NULL results in a panic "FlushChannel: damaned channel list" ! This panic
     error is raised in the "CloseChannel" function in the tclIO.c file.
     I tried to understand the problem but couldn't find it !
     (perhaps a TCL bug ....)
     
     CONSEQUENCE :
     This problem may result in a growing memory if you use tons of shared channels
     (because the channel structure will never be deallocated because attached to the 
     NULL interpreter). But for a standard usage it should be OK.
     
     For my usage, I open a socket indefinitely so I don't care
     about closing the channel.

* ns_detachfile
     after opening a channel in a TCL script, you can call ns_detachfile passing the
     channel name to detach the channel. The channel is STILL avalaible in the script
     but won't be closed at the end of the script.
     You can use "nsv_set" to save the channel name

* ns_attachfile
     You can call ns_attachfile passing the channel name to attach the channel to the
     actual interpreter. The channel will become available and you'll be able to use
     the standard "puts", "gets" and "flush" TCL command. You can "close" the channel
     but it has no effect, SO DON'T FORGET TO FLUSH IT BEFORE THE END OF YOUR SCRIPT !
     
* ns_closesharedchannel
     Passing the channel name, it will close the shared channel. The channel will be
     still opened in the local TCL interp. It is your responsability to close it
     by calling the TCL "close" command.

How to Build:
=============

* Requires GNU Make (available from the GNU project at
  http://www.gnu.org.  It is usually called "make-*.tar.gz" on the GNU ftp
  sites)

* Edit the Makefile and set NSHOME to the location of your AOLserver
  source or binary tree.

* Run "make" or "gmake" (whichever is GNU Make).

* Run "make install" or copy "nssharechannel.so" to your
  AOLserver bin directory.


What's New:

2.0: Added C functions ns_DetachTclChannel, Ns_AttachTclChannelByName.

     Added TCL function ns_closesharedchannel and C function
     Ns_CloseSharedChannel for server using TCL version >= 8.4
     
     If TCL version >= 8.4 at compile time, the module will close
     all the remaining shared channel at server shutdown.

1.1: Using TCL_HashTable to save data.
	 "MaxSharedChannels" is now USELESS.
     
     For info my environment is the following :
     - SunOS 5.7 on a Netra machine
     - AOLServer 3.2 running Tcl7.6
     - Oracle driver 2.5
     
1.0: First version of the nssharefd module for AOLServer.
     The TCL commands are created that allows to detach and attach channels :
     ns_detachchannel channelID -> in the interp which open the channel
     ns_attachchannel channelID -> in the interp which want to use the channel
     
     You can use the "nsv_set" functions to share the channelID.
     The default number of channels you can share is 10.
     You can change it :
     
     ns_section "ns/server/${server_name}/module/nssharefd"
     ns_param	MaxSharedChannels 20
